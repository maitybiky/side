            "Localization of content has ruled the roost last year and will
            continue to be a defining trend in 2022 as well. There’s an upswing
            in viewing demand coming in from non-urban India and the year ahead
            will witness an increased focus on preferred languages that will not
            just be limited to content but other allied services like UIs and
            subtitles.Alongside, SVOD would continue to grow aggressively with
            increasing cohorts of audiences choosing to pay for good content. I
            believe the right synergy of compelling content and price point
            would be the key in attracting a bigger share of consumers. Needless
            to say, differentiated programming would be imperative to add to a
            brand's competitive advantage.
            <br />
            However, with the proliferation of digital, linear would also
            witness an upward rise, building further on last year's growth. As
            both the platforms stand to coexist, content will emerge as the
            biggest differentiating factor, with viewer preferences transcending
            languages and geographies. To summarize, TV &amp; Digital will grow

            The other is the concept of the Global MarketPlace. I refrain from
            calling it the global village because while technology has shrunk
            the world, the last few years have shown us that the global
