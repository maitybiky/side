              Ghana is a developing country and the first country in West Africa
              to declare independence. It is a country of diverse people, where
              cultural beliefs and societal support are critical. As a country,
              Ghana believes in universal quality education, but due to its
              developing economy, there are pockets where people, specifically
              girls, are marginalized.

              In response to the UN SDGs goals, Ghana has developed various
              policies over the years to enhance the livelihood of the
              marginalized, especially girls. Unfortunately, due to inherent
              cultural norms, the measures have not yielded significant results.
              Although there is free basic education, access to this service
              cannot be considered free due to various hidden costs of a child’s
              upbringing. The average Girl in a rural setting in Ghana needs
              less than $70 a month to cater to her education as well as basic
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Ghana has adopted the UN’s SDGs and believes in expanding
              its efforts to achieve them, the country is embracing partnership
              opportunities to ensure girls’ access to education and
              professional development.

              The IAA has steadily been growing across the African continent.
              With that growth comes the opportunity for the IAA to ensure it
              leaves a mark on the continent.

              IAA Africa currently boasts 2 chapters, namely Ghana and Nigeria.
              Ghana is widely regarded as the second home of the IAA as it is
              the heart of the IAA’s opening into Africa.

              The current World Chairman and President of the IAA, Mr. Joel
              Nettey, hails from Ghana and is the first black President since
              the Association’s inception. Other members of the IAA Africa team
              hold senior positions in the Global IAA community: Mrs. Norkor
              Duah is the VP/Area Director-Africa and has been the overseer of
              the IAA’s Africa Rising conference since its inception. She also
              served as IAA Ghana’s first female President and is a Princess
              from the Kingdom of Amanokrom.

              The Managing Director of the IAA, Dagmara Szulce on her most
              recent trip to Ghana was also made an “Ankobea,” meaning Councilor
              by the King and people of Amanokrom, a community in Ghana. An
              advocate for the empowerment and education of girls, Dagmara
              together with the leadership of the IAA have made it a mission to
              help educate brilliant but needy students in rural communities
              across Africa starting with Ghana.

              OBAA (meaning Girl) is an initiative created by IAA in partnership
              with Global Women in Business with an affinity for Africa towards
              uplifting the relevance of female education and ensuring a better
              future for girls who are starting their journey in Ghana. By
              providing them with mentorship and giving opportunities for better
              all-rounded education, we create new perspectives, give hope, and
              foster opportunities for a better future.

              Like in every developing country, there are opportunities TO GROW
              but due to cultural and societal practices, not everyone is able

              The world cannot be considered evolved unless girls are allowed to
              reach their full educational and professional potential,
              regardless of their backgrounds and financial situations. Most
              girls in rural parts of Ghana, however, are not able to move
              beyond the free basic education due to significant economic and
              cultural constraints. The average Girl in a rural setting in Ghana
              needs an estimated $700 per year to cater to her basic needs and
              education.
